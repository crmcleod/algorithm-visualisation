# Sorting Algorithm Visualisation
### Currently implemented
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort

### Objective
Create an application to visualise an algorithm/algorithms. The intention was to show how algorithms sort side by side (this therefore means that the 'real-time' sorting isn't accurate as the 'steps' share the same timing intervals).

### Deployment
[Demo available here!](https://crmcleod.github.io/algorithm-visualisation/)


### Technology
* React
